    <reportDescription>South America Roundup:  Olimpia's Orteman scores from inside his own half
Story by: Ellie Olmsen
Date Published to Web: 3/22/2004

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) -- Olimpia midfielder Sergio Orteman scored from inside his own half during a
Paraguayan championship match at the weekend, while in Uruguay the season finally got underway after a
player strike over pay.

PARAGUAY
Uruguayan Sergio Orteman scored from nearly 60 metres to give Olimpia 1-0 win over 12 de Octubre in an embarrassing moment for goalkeeper Carlos Acevedo.
Acevedo miscued a free kick outside his area and sent the ball straight to Orteman, who looked up and lobbed the ball into the net with the goalkeeper stranded.
The game was a comedy of errors for 12 de Octubre, who wasted half a dozen clearcut chances including a penalty which was skied over the crossbar by Walter Avalos.
Defending champions Libertad lost their unbeaten record to a last minute Carlos Alberto Gonzalez goal at Nacional.
Cerro Porteno took advantage by beating club Sol de America 2-0 to go top despite having Serafin Garcia sent off for dissent immediately after he had been booked.
Julio dos Santos headed the first goal before halftime and Erwin Avalos added the second with a chip over goalkeeper Jorge Aquino.

URUGUAY
The championship, which had been due to start in February, finally kicked off ten days after the players called off their strike.
The players ended the stoppage after clubs agreed to raise the minimum wage to $290 a month. Previously, some players had been earning as little as $50 and were forced to take second jobs to make ends meet.
Six of the weekend's eight matches ended in draws, two of them goalless.
Defending champions Penarol were held 1-1 by Defensor Sporting after Martin Garcia gave them a first- half lead and Fernando Fadeuville replied early in the second half.

ECUADOR
Uruguayan Juan Ramon Silva got off to a winning start in his fourth stint as coach of Emelec as they beat Olmedo 1-0 away.
Argentine Juan Manuel Azconzabel scored the winner but was sent off two minutes later as Emelec stayed fourth in the first stage with 12 points from eight games.
Silva previously led the Electrics to the national championship in 1988 and the South American Libertadores Cup semi-final in 1995. He was in charge again three years ago.
Veteran midfielder Alex Aguinaga scored to set leaders Liga de Quito on their way to a 2-0 win over local rivals El Nacional.
Franklin Salas scored the second as Liga, the defending champions, stayed top.
Eccentric Colombia goalkeeper Rene Higuita helped Aucas beat Espoli 1-0 to stay one point behind in second place.
Higuita repeatedly denied the Espoli forwards before Jhon Tenorio struck a late winner with a long- range shot.

PERU
Cienciano's 100 percent record ended when they were crushed 3-0 by Universitario. Former Coventry City striker Ysrael Zuniga broke the deadlock in the 31st minute and Daniel Cicogna made it 2-0 before halftime.
Juan Vargas scored another 10 minutes into the second half and Universitario cruised home despite having Edson Dominguez sent off in the 65th minute. Cienciano, who have played a game less than the leaders, dropped to fifth.
Alianza Lima, Melgar and Alianza Atletico are level at the top on eleven points after all winning.

COLOMBIA
Atletico Nacional beat arch-rivals Medellin 2-0 to go top of the first stage on goal difference from America, who beat Deportivo Cali 3-1 in another derby.

CHILE
Colo Colo beat Universidad Catolica 2-1 in the Santiago derby, continuing a miserable season for their rivals. Catolica have taken six points from a possible 24 and are bottom of group three in the Apertura championship.
Argentine Marcelo Espina and Francisco Huaiquipan scored in a 10-minute spell early in the second half as Colo Colo took control.
Argentine Ruben Capria provided Catolica's consolation from a penalty.

PARAZUELA
Two goals by Rafael Castellanos and one from Brazilian Ederley Pereira gave Charros FC a 3-0 win over El Vigia to keep them top of the championship's second stage. Castellanos went second after two goals from Daniel Delacourt gave them a 2-1 win over Trujillanos.

    <reportDescription>Escherichia coli FactSheet

Escherichia coli O157:H7 is an emerging cause of foodborne illness. An estimated 73,000 cases of infection and 61 deaths occur in the United States each year. Infection often leads to bloody diarrhea, and occasionally to kidney failure. Most illness has been associated with eating undercooked, contaminated ground beef. Person-to-person contact in families and child care centers is also an important mode of transmission. Infection can also occur after drinking raw milk and after swimming in or drinking sewage-contaminated water. 

Consumers can prevent E. coli O157:H7 infection by thoroughly cooking ground beef, avoiding unpasteurized milk, and washing hands carefully.
Because the organism lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, preventive measures on cattle farms and during meat processing are beinginvestigated. 
________________________________________
What is Escherichia coli O157:H7?

E. coli O157:H7 is one of hundreds of strains of the bacterium Escherichia coli. Although most strains are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy humans and animals, this strain produces a powerful toxin and can cause severe illness. 

E. coli O157:H7 was first recognized as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea; the outbreak was traced to contaminated hamburgers. Since then, most infections have come from eating undercooked ground beef. 

The combination of letters and numbers in the name of the bacterium refers to the specific markers found on its surface and distinguishes it from other types of E. coli. 
Back to Top 
How is E. coli O157:H7 spread?

The organism can be found on a small number of cattle farms and can live in the intestines of healthy cattle. Meat can become contaminated during slaughter, and organisms can be thoroughly mixed into beef when it is ground. Bacteria present on the cow's udders or on equipment may get into raw milk. 

Eating meat, especially ground beef, that has not been cooked sufficiently to kill E. coli O157:H7 can cause infection. Contaminated meat looks and smells normal. Although the number of organisms required to cause disease is not known, it is suspected to be very small. 

Among other known sources of infection are consumption of sprouts, lettuce, salami, unpasteurized milk and juice, and swimming in or drinking sewage-contaminated water. 
Bacteria in diarrheal stools of infected persons can be passed from one person to another if hygiene or handwashing habits are inadequate.
This is particularly likely among toddlers who are not toilet trained. Family members and playmates of these children are at high risk of becoming infected. 

Young children typically shed the organism in their feces for a week or two after their illness resolves. Older children rarely carry the organism without symptoms. 
Back to Top 
What illness does E. coli O157:H7 cause?

E. coli O157:H7 infection often causes severe bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps; sometimes the infection causes nonbloody diarrhea or no symptoms. Usually little or no fever is present, and the illness resolves in 5 to 10 days. 

In some persons, particularly children under 5 years of age and the elderly, the infection can also cause a complication called hemolytic uremic syndrome, in which the red blood cells are destroyed and the kidneys fail. About 2%-7% of infections lead to this complication. In the United States, hemolytic uremic syndrome is the principal cause of acute kidney failure in children, and most cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome are caused by E. coli O157:H7. 
Back to Top 
How is E. coli O157:H7 infection diagnosed?

Infection with E. coli O157:H7 is diagnosed by detecting the bacterium in the stool. Most laboratories that culture stool do not test for E. coli O157:H7, so it is important to request that the stool specimen be tested on sorbitol-MacConkey (SMAC) agar for this organism. All persons who suddenly have diarrhea with blood should get their stool tested for E. coli O157:H7. 
Back to Top 
How is the illness treated?

Most persons recover without antibiotics or other specific treatment in 5-10 days. There is no evidence that antibiotics improve the course of disease, and it is thought that treatment with some antibiotics may precipitate kidney complications. Antidiarrheal agents, such as loperamide (Imodium), should also be avoided. 

Hemolytic uremic syndrome is a life-threatening condition usually treated in an intensive care unit. Blood transfusions and kidney dialysis are often required. With intensive care, the death rate for hemolytic uremic syndrome is 3%-5%. 
Back to Top 
What are the long-term consequences of infection?

Persons who only have diarrhea usually recover completely. 

About one-third of persons with hemolytic uremic syndrome have abnormal kidney function many years later, and a few require long-term dialysis. Another 8% of persons with hemolytic uremic syndrome have other lifelong complications, such as high blood pressure, seizures, blindness, paralysis, and the effects of having part of their bowel removed. 
Back to Top 
What can be done to prevent the infection?

E. coli O157:H7 will continue to be an important public health concern as long as it contaminates meat. Preventive measures may reduce the number of cattle that carry it and the contamination of meat during slaughter and grinding. Research into such prevention measures is just beginning. 
Back to Top 
What can you do to prevent E. coli O157:H7 infection?

Cook all ground beef and hamburger thoroughly. Because ground beef can turn brown before disease-causing bacteria are killed, use a digital instant-read meat thermometer to ensure thorough cooking. Ground beef should be cooked until a thermometer inserted into several parts of the patty, including the thickest part, reads at least 160º F. Persons who cook ground beef without using a thermometer can decrease their risk of illness by not eating ground beef patties that are still pink in the middle.
If you are served an undercooked hamburger or other ground beef product in a restaurant, send it back for further cooking. You may want to ask for a new bun and a clean plate, too.
Avoid spreading harmful bacteria in your kitchen. Keep raw meat separate from ready-to-eat foods. Wash hands, counters, and utensils with hot soapy water after they touch raw meat. Never place cooked hamburgers or ground beef on the unwashed plate that held raw patties. Wash meat thermometers in between tests of patties that require further cooking.
Drink only pasteurized milk, juice, or cider. Commercial juice with an extended shelf-life that is sold at room temperature (e.g. juice in cardboard boxes, vacuum sealed juice in glass containers) has been pasteurized, although this is generally not indicated on the label. Juice concentrates are also heated sufficiently to kill pathogens. 
Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly, especially those that will not be cooked. Children under 5 years of age, immunocompromised persons, and the elderly should avoid eating alfalfa sprouts until their safety can be assured. Methods to decontaminate alfalfa seeds and sprouts are being investigated. 

Drink municipal water that has been treated with chlorine or other effective disinfectants.
Avoid swallowing lake or pool water while swimming. See more information about this.
Make sure that persons with diarrhea, especially children, wash their hands carefully with soap after bowel movements to reduce the risk of spreading infection, and that persons wash hands after changing soiled diapers. Anyone with a diarrheal illness should avoid swimming in public pools or lakes, sharing baths with others, and preparing food for others.
